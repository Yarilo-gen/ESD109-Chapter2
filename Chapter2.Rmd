# Binomial Distribution 

* A binomial experiment consists of a fixed number of $n$ trials. 
* Each trial has two possible outcomes: success, failure. 
* The probability ofsuccess is denoted by $p$, $0\leq p \leq 1$;
* The probability of failure is $1-p$. 
* The trials are independent: the outcome of one trial does not affect the  outcome probability of any other trial.
